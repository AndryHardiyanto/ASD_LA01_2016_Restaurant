Dear Students,

1st meeting material and Team can be seen in attached 1st meeting.zip file.

For this course tasks, we will make a software following scrum practice.

We make a software for a restaurant that cover all of the process that exists in a restaurant such as supplier, inventory, accounting, production, sales, marketing, etc.. (will be added later depending on condition)

for the software we will be using:
- php for server side script (can use laravel / codeigniter / yii / other simple framework for web service)
- mysql for database engine
- apache for web server
- HTML for User Interface
- javascript for client side script (using angularjs for template engine)
- for repository we will use github: https://github.com/suryawang/ASD_LA01_2016_Restaurant


please learn those and discuss it on this forum if you have difficulties to understand the technology.

for the development we do the following things according to scrum practice:
- make a product backlog
- sprint planning
- daily scrum (sprint execution)
- sprint review (potensial shippable product increment)
- sprint retrospective (integration)

we will discussing the scrum tools first and do adaptation accordingly

Regards,
Surya
